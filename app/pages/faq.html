<h1>MBOX to CSV FAQ</h1>
<p>This page collects the most common questions from customers searching for “mbox csv” support. If you do not see your issue answered below, <a href="/contact">email the operator</a> and we will help.</p>
<div class="faq-card" id="size">
  <h2>What file size can I upload?</h2>
  <p>Each conversion job supports uploads up to <strong>20 GB</strong>. The system streams directly to disk, which prevents browser memory crashes. If your archive is larger, split it into multiple files using the export tool of your email provider and queue them one after another.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-card" id="formats">
  <h2>Which formats are supported?</h2>
  <p>mbox-csv.com handles standard <strong>.mbox</strong> files from Gmail, Thunderbird, Apple Mail, Yahoo, Proton, Zoho, and other clients. Outlook users can upload a <strong>.pst</strong> file; the service extracts the mailbox and converts it into the same CSV layout. We can also ingest <strong>.eml</strong> collections on request.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-card" id="columns">
  <h2>What columns are included in the CSV?</h2>
  <p>Every row includes <code>date</code>, <code>from</code>, <code>to</code>, <code>cc</code>, <code>bcc</code>, <code>subject</code>, and <code>message_id</code>. These fields cover most compliance and CRM import workflows. If you need message bodies or attachments, <a href="/contact">reach out</a> for a scoped export.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-card" id="speed">
  <h2>How fast is the conversion?</h2>
  <p>Processing time depends on message count. Small archives (under 1 GB) usually finish in a couple of minutes. Multi-gigabyte exports may run for longer; the progress meter on the homepage updates so you always know how many messages are done.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-card" id="privacy">
  <h2>How is my data protected?</h2>
  <p>Uploads are stored in a private working directory tied to your job ID. When the CSV is zipped and handed back, both the source file and output archive are scheduled for deletion. HTTPS is enforced end-to-end. See the <a href="/privacy">privacy policy</a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-card" id="errors">
  <h2>How do I fix upload errors?</h2>
  <p>If you see a “file too large” message, the archive exceeded 20 GB. Split the export and retry. For “Not ready” download errors, the job may still be processing—wait for the status to show <strong>Ready</strong> or <strong>Done</strong> and refresh. Persistent issues? <a href="/contact">Contact support</a> with the job ID.</p>
</div>
<p class="note">Tip: bookmark <a href="https://mbox-csv.com">mbox-csv.com</a> so the official converter is easy to find the next time you search for “mbox csv”.</p>
