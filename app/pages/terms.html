<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your access to and use of <strong>mbox-csv.com</strong> (the “Service”). By uploading an archive or downloading an export you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>
<h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
<p>The Service converts MBOX archives into CSV files. Optional toggles include Gmail thread identifiers, plain-text message bodies, and an attachments manifest. PST uploads require manual assistance from the operator.</p>
<h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal right to upload the email data you submit. By using the Service you confirm you have all necessary permissions from the mailbox owner.</p>
<h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not upload content that violates the law, infringes intellectual property, or contains malicious code.</li>
  <li>Do not attempt to reverse engineer, disrupt, or overload the infrastructure running the Service.</li>
  <li>Automated use is allowed for internal workflows so long as requests respect published limits (20 GB per job) and do not degrade availability for others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Privacy and data retention</h2>
<p>Uploaded files are stored in isolated directories and are automatically deleted after the conversion finishes or within 24 hours, whichever comes first. See the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details on processing.</p>
<h2>5. Warranties and disclaimers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. No guarantee is made that every archive will convert successfully.</li>
  <li>Exports should be reviewed before relying on them for legal, compliance, or business decisions.</li>
  <li>The operator is not responsible for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from use of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Changes to the Terms</h2>
<p>The Terms may be updated periodically. Material changes will be noted on this page with a revised “last updated” date. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>
